Most modern web and mobile applications work by continuously connecting to back-end servers to send and receive data. With most applications heavily relying on back-end servers to process data, testing and securing the back-end servers is quickly becoming more important.

Testing web requests to back-end servers make up the bulk of Web Application Penetration Testing, which includes concepts that apply to both web and mobile applications. To capture the requests and traffic passing between applications and back-end servers and manipulate these types of requests for testing purposes, we need to useÂ `Web Proxies`

## What are web proxies?

Web proxies are tools that go between a web applcation and a backend server in order to view all the requests being sent between both ends. 

## Uses of Web Proxies

While the primary use of web proxies is to capture and replay HTTP requests, they have many other features that enable different uses for web proxies. The following list shows some of the other tasks we may use web proxies for:

- Web application vulnerability scanning
- Web fuzzing
- Web crawling
- Web application mapping
- Web request analysis
- Web configuration testing
- Code reviews
