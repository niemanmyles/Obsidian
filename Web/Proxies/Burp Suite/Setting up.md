## Burp Suite

If Burp is not pre-installed in our VM, we can start by downloading it from [Burp's Download Page](https://portswigger.net/burp/releases/). Once downloaded, we can run the installer and follow the instructions, which vary from one operating system to another, but should be pretty straightforward. There are installers for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Once installed, Burp can either be launched from the terminal by typing `burpsuite`, or from the application menu as previously mentioned. Another option is to download the `JAR` file (which can be used on all operating systems with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed) from the above downloads page. We can run it with the following command line or by double-clicking it:

mylesnieman@htb[/htb]`$ java -jar </path/to/burpsuite.jar>`

When opening burp, you're prompted to make a new project![[Pasted image 20240528102710.jpg]]
