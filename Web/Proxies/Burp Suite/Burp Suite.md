## Burp Suite

[Burp Suite (Burp)](https://portswigger.net/burp) -pronounced Burp Sweet- is the most common web proxy for web penetration testing. It has an excellent user interface for its various features and even provides a built-in Chromium browser to test web applications. Certain Burp features are only available in the commercial version `Burp Pro/Enterprise`, but even the free version is an extremely powerful testing tool to keep in our arsenal.

Some of the `paid-only` features are:

- Active web app scanner
- Fast Burp Intruder
- The ability to load certain Burp Extensions

The community `free` version of Burp Suite should be enough for most penetration testers. Once we start more advanced web application penetration testing, the `pro` features may become handy. Most of the features we will cover in this module are available in the community `free` version of Burp Suite, but we will also touch upon some of the `pro` features, like the Active Web App Scanner.
