## Response Codes

HTTP status codes are used to tell the client the status of their request. An HTTP server can return five types of response codes:

|**Type**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`1xx`|Provides information and does not affect the processing of the request.|
|`2xx`|Returned when a request succeeds.|
|`3xx`|Returned when the server redirects the client.|
|`4xx`|Signifies improper requests `from the client`. For example, requesting a resource that doesn't exist or requesting a bad format.|
|`5xx`|Returned when there is some problem `with the HTTP server` itself.|

The following are some of the commonly seen examples from each of the above HTTP method types:

|**Code**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`200 OK`|Returned on a successful request, and the response body usually contains the requested resource.|
|`302 Found`|Redirects the client to another URL. For example, redirecting the user to their dashboard after a successful login.|
|`400 Bad Request`|Returned on encountering malformed requests such as requests with missing line terminators.|
|`403 Forbidden`|Signifies that the client doesn't have appropriate access to the resource. It can also be returned when the server detects malicious input from the user.|
|`404 Not Found`|Returned when the client requests a resource that doesn't exist on the server.|
|`500 Internal Server Error`|Returned when the server cannot process the request.|

Apart from the standard HTTP codes, various servers and providers such as [Cloudflare](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003014432-HTTP-Status-Codes) or [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSimpleDB/latest/DeveloperGuide/APIError.html) implement their own codes.
