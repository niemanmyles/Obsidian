Fuzzing is sending different data within requests

Fuzz all parts of URL: 
	Example: /api/v2/resources/books?published=2000 
	- Try changing v2 to a lower version
	- Try fuzzing 'books'
	- Try fuzzing 'published'
	- try fuzzing the actual data passed in the url parameter

**You should make sure to try all attacks on each version of the API**!

How? 

[[Burp Suite]] or [[wfuzz]] or another fuzzing tool
