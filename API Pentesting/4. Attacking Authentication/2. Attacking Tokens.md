Tokens are trusted by the server, so if you can manage to steal or guess someone's token, you will essentially be them.

Analyzing tokens: 

You can use burp suite's sequencer to analyze tokens from a given endpoint. Tell the sequencer what to look for and then "Start live capture" (this makes a ton of requests). 

Sometimes you'll want to decode the token before saving it, for example, when it's base64 encoded, so you can do proper analysis on it.
